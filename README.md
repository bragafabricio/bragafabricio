### Hi there 😁👋

My name is Fabricio Braga. I am a Computer Scientist, passionate for technology and everything there is to learn about it. I could talk for more than half an hour, without any headsup, about: classic videogames and videogames modding, rollerblading, learning and educational platforms and traveling.   

Would you like to find me?
